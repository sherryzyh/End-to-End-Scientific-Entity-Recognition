Abstract 
We present a resource for the task of FrameNet semantic frame disambiguation of over 5,000 word - sentence pairs from the Wikipedia cor- pus . 
The annotations were collected using a novel crowdsourcing approach with mul- tiple workers per sentence to capture inter- annotator disagreement . 
In contrast to the typical approach of attributing the best single frame to each word , we provide a list of frames with disagreement - based scores that express the conÔ¨Ådence with which each frame applies to the word . 
This is based on the idea that inter - annotator disagreement is at least partly caused by ambiguity that is inherent to the text and frames . 
We have found many examples where the semantics of individual frames over- lap sufÔ¨Åciently to make them acceptable alter- 
natives for interpreting a sentence . 
We have argued that ignoring this ambiguity creates an overly arbitrary target for training and eval- uating natural language processing systems - if humans can not agree , why would we ex- pect the correct answer from a machine to be any different ? 
To process this data we also utilized an expanded lemma - set provided by the Framester system , which merges FN with WordNet to enhance coverage . 
Our dataset includes annotations of 1,000 sentence - word pairs whose lemmas are not part of FN . 
Finally we present metrics for evaluating frame disam- biguation systems that account for ambiguity . 
1 Introduction Crowdsourcing has been a popular method to col- lect corpora for a variety of natural language pro- cessing tasks ( Snow et al . , 2008 ) , although one of its downsides is the crowd ‚Äôs lack of domain knowledge that is helpful in solving some tasks . 
Semantic frame disambiguation is an example of a complex natural language processing task that is usually performed by linguistic experts , sub- jected to strict annotation guidelines and qualitycontrol ( Baker , 2012 ) . 
The theory of frame se- mantics ( J Fillmore , 1982 ) deÔ¨Ånes a frame as an abstract representation of a word sense , describing a type of entity , relation , or event , together with the associated roles implied by the frame . 
The FrameNet ( FN ) corpus ( Baker et al . , 1998 ) is a col- lection of semantic frames , together with a corpus of documents annotated with these frames . 
Simi- larly to word - sense disambiguation , frame disam- biguation is the task of obtaining the correct frame for each word , since many words have multiple possible meanings . 
Using domain experts for frame disambigua- tion is expensive and time consuming , resulting in small corpora for this task that do not scale well for modern machine learning methods ‚Äì FN ver- sion 1.7 , the latest one at the time of writing , con- tains only about 10,000 sentences annotated with frames . 
Furthermore , only using one expert to per- form the annotation makes it difÔ¨Åcult to capture any diversity of perspectives . 
There have been a number of small - scale at- tempts at using crowdsourcing for frame disam- biguation in sentences , showing that the crowd has comparable performance to the FN domain ex- perts ( Hong and Baker , 2011 ) , and that the crowd can be used to correct wrong examples that have been collected automatically ( Pavlick et al . , 2015 ) . 
Crowd performance can be improved by combin- ing frame role identiÔ¨Åcation with disambiguation ( Fossati et al . , 2013 ) , or by asking crowd workers to give each other feedback and then letting them change their answer ( Chang et al . , 2015 ) . 
Crowd- sourcing has also been useful to identify the ambi- guity in frame disambiguation ( Jurgens , 2013 ) . 
Previously , we have shown ( Dumitrache et al . , 2018a ) that while the crowd and FN expert mostly agree over frame disambiguation , disagreement cases are often caused by ambiguity , such as vague or overlapping frame deÔ¨Ånitions , or incomplete 
2165information in the sentence . 
Because of these issues with the input data , the approach of se- lecting one single correct frame for every word , and ignoring alternative interpretations , often re- sults in arbitrary , incomplete ground truth cor- pora . 
In order to aggregate annotated data while preserving disagreement , we use the CrowdTruth method1(Aroyo and Welty , 2014 ) , which encour- ages using multiple crowd annotators to perform the same work , and processes the disagreement between them to signal low quality workers , sen- tences , and frames . 
This paper presents a crowdsourced FN frame disambiguation corpus of 5,042 sentence - word pairs ( which has since grown to over 9,000 since the submission of this paper ) . 
More than 1,000 of these are lexical units ( LUs ) not part of FN . 
To our knowledge , it is the largest corpus of this type outside of FN . 
In addition , we applied the CrowdTruth method , in which each sentence and lexical item is accompanied by a list of mul- tiple frames with scores that express the conÔ¨Å- dence with which each frame applies to the word . 
This allows us to demonstrate that ambiguity is a prominent feature of frame disambiguation , with many cases where more than one possible frame can apply to the same word . 
Finally , we present an evaluation of several frame disambiguation mod- els using evaluation metrics that leverage the mul- tiple answers and their conÔ¨Ådence scores , and show that even a model that always predicts the top crowd answer will not always have the best performance . 
2 Corpus Collection & Analysis 2.1 Data Preprocessing Our corpus consists of 5,042 candidate word- sentence pairs from Wikipedia ( which has since grown to over 9,000 since the submission of this paper ) and a candidate list of frames for the word , with 742 unique frames and 1,705 unique lexical units ( LUs ) . 
The sentences have been randomly selected , based on these criteria : The candidate word has no more than 25 can- didate frames , to not overwhelm the annota- tors . 
The part of speech of the word is a verb . 
1http://crowdtruth.orgThedistribution of candidate frames was op- timized for maximum diversity using a greedy approach . 
To gather the candidate frames for each word , we gathered the candidate frames associated with the LU from FN1.7 . 
Next we completed the candidate list using Framester ( Gangemi et al . , 2016 ) , which maps FN semantic frames to syn- onym sets from WordNet ( Miller , 1995 ) . 
The sen- tences were processed with tokenization , sentence splitting , lemmatization and part - of - speech tag- ging . 
Then each word with a frame attached to it was matched with all of its possible synonym sets from WordNet , while making sure that the part - of- speech constraint of the synonym set is fulÔ¨Ålled . 
Using the WordNet mapping , we constructed the list of additional candidate frames for each word . 
Framester disambiguation used release 1.5 of FN , and some frames changed names in version 1.7 , so we manually mapped these frames from FS to their latest version . 
Framester disambiguation was also used to collect a subset of our corpus consist- 
ing of 1,000 sentence - word pairs with LUs that are not part of the FN corpus . 
For simplicity , we refer to the sentence - word pairs as sentences in the rest of the paper . 
2.2 Crowdsourcing Setup We ran the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk , where the workers were asked to select all frames that Ô¨Åt the sense of the highlighted word in a sen- tence from the multiple choice candidate list , or that none of the frames is correct . 
We used 15 workers / sentence that were paid $ 0.05 for each judgment , and a total cost of $ 1.35 per sentence ( after factoring in the additional AMT costs).2 To aggregate the results of the crowd while also capturing inter - annotator disagreement , we use the CrowdTruth metrics3(Dumitrache et 
al . , 2018b ) , replicating the setup from our previous work ( Du- mitrache et al . , 2018a ) . 
The choice of frames of one worker over one sentence are aggregated into aworker vector ‚Äì a binary vector with n+ 1com- ponents , where nis the number of frames shown together with the sentence , where the decision to pick each of the frames ( or none ) corresponds to a component in the vector . 
The vectors are used to calculate quality scores for workers , sentences 2https://mturk.com/ 3https://github.com/CrowdTruth/ CrowdTruth - core

and frames . 
Although we make all quality scores available as part of the corpus , in this paper we focus on : frame - sentence score ( FSS ): the degree with which a frame matches the sense of the word in the sentence . 
It is the ratio of workers that picked the frame to all the workers that read the sentence , weighted by the worker quality . 
A high FSS means the frame is clearly expressed in a sentence . 
sentence quality ( SQS ): the overall worker agreement over one sentence . 
It is the av- erage cosine similarity over all worker vec- tors for one sentence , weighted by the worker quality and frame quality . 
A high SQS indi- cates a clear sentence . 
The aggregated crowdsourcing results and the FN 1.5 to 1.7 mapping table are available online.4 2.3 Ambiguity in the Corpus An analysis of the corpus found many examples of inter - annotator disagreement , of which a few ex- amples are shown in Table 1 . 
For 720 sentences , a majority of the workers picked at least 2 frames ( examples 1 - 3 in Table 1 ) . 
And for 1,514 sen- tences , no one frame has been picked by a major- ity of the workers ( examples 4 - 7 in Table 1 ) . 
Dis- agreement is also more prominent in the sentences where the LU is not a part of FN ( Figure 1 ) . 
The disagreement comes from a variety of causes : a parent - child relation between the frames ( statement andcommunication in # 3 ) , an overlap in the deÔ¨Ånition of the frames ( accomplishment 4https://github.com/CrowdTruth/ FrameDisambiguationandsuccessful action in # 2 ) , the meaning of the word is expressed by a composition of frames ( in # 7 , ‚Äú straightening of the knee ‚Äù is a combination ofreshaping the form of the knee , arranging the knee in the right position , and body movement ) , and combinations of all of these reasons ( in # 4 , ‚Äú slices ‚Äù is a combination of part piece andcause harm , and the other frames are their children ) . 
More example sentences for each type of disagree- ment are available in the appendix . 
The sentences themselves are not difÔ¨Åcult to understand , and it can be argued that all of them have one frame that applies the best for the word . 
The goal of this cor- pus is to show that next to this best frame for the word , there are other frames that apply to a lesser degree , or capture a different part of the meaning . 
When evaluating a model for frame disambigua- tion , it seems unfair to penalize misclassiÔ¨Åcations of frames that still apply to the word , but with less clarity , in the same way we would penalize a frame that captures a wrong meaning . 
Also , we argue that models should take into account that annota- tors do not agree over some examples , and treat them differently than clear expressions of frames . 
Disagreement can also be caused by worker mis- takes ( in # 6 , dimension refers to the size of the object , not the act of measuring the size ) . 
While we try to mitigate for this by weighing conÔ¨Ådence scores with the worker quality , the mistakes still appear in the corpus . 
This type of disagreement could be useful in future work to identify exam- ples that workers need to be trained on . 
3 Evaluating Frame Disambiguation 3.1 Systems Tested As an example usage of our corpus , we used it to evaluate these frame disambiguation models :

1.OS : The Open - Sesame ( Swayamdipta et al . , 2017 ) classiÔ¨Åer , pre - trained on the FN corpus ( release 1.7 ) . 
Given a word - sentence pair , OS uses a BiLSTM model with a softmax Ô¨Ånal layer to predict a single frame for the word . 
If the LU is not in FN , it can not make a pre- diction . 
2.OS+ : We modiÔ¨Åed the OS classiÔ¨Åer to per- form multi - label classiÔ¨Åcation . 
To calculate the conÔ¨Ådence score for candidate frame f , we removed the softmax layer and passed the output of the BiLSTM model (f)through the following transformation : c(f ) = 
[ 1 + tanh ( f)]=2 . 
This gave a score c(f)2[0;1 ] expressing the conÔ¨Ådence that frame fis ex- 
pressed in the sentence . 
3.FS : Framester includes a tool for rule - based multi - class multi - label frame disambigua- tion ( Gangemi et al . , 2016 ) . 
While for the dataset pre - processing ( Sec . 2 ) we considered the frames for all synsets a word is part of , FS performs an additional word - sense disam- biguation step to return a more precise list of frames . 
We used the tool with proÔ¨Åle T as it was shown to have the overall better perfor- mance . 
FS can only predict FN frames from the 1.5 release , which is missing 202 frames from version 1.7 . 
While OS+ produces conÔ¨Ådence scores , the other methods produce binary labels for each frame - sentence pair . 
These models do not have state - of - the - art performance ( Hermann et al . , 2014 ; FitzGerald et al . , 2015 ) , we picked them be- 
cause they were accessible and allowed testing on a novel corpus . 
Finally , we evaluate the quality of the TCcorpus , containing only the top frame picked by the crowd for every sentence . 
This test shows what is the best possible performance over our corpus that can be expected from a system such as OS that selects a single frame per sentence .

3.2 Evaluation Metrics & Results Instead of traditional evaluation metrics that re- quire binary labels , we propose an evaluation methodology that is able to consider multiple can- didate frames for each sentence and their quality scores . 
We use Kendall ‚Äôs 
list ranking coefÔ¨Å- cient ( Kendall , 1938 ) and cosine similarity to cal- culate the distance between the list of frames pro- duced by the crowd labeled with the FSS , and the frames predicted by the baselines in each sen- tence . 
Whereas Kendall ‚Äôs 
only accounts for the ranking of the FSS for each frame , cosine similar- ity uses the actual FSS values in the calculation of the similarity . 
Both metrics compute a score per sentence ( Kendall ‚Äôs 
2[ 1;1 ] , and cosine similarity2[0;1 ] ) . 
Using these metrics , we pro- duce two aggregate statistics over our test corpus : ( 1 ) the area - under - curve ( AUC ) for each metric , normalized by the corpus size , and ( 2 ) the SQS - weighted average of each metric ( w avg ) , which also accounts for the ambiguity of the sentence as expressed by the SQS . 
We evaluate on two ver- sions of the corpus : ( 1 ) the restricted set ( R - S ET ) of 4,000 sentences with LUs from the FN corpus , and ( 2 ) the full set ( F - S ET ) of 5,042 sentences . 
The results ( Figure 2 & Table 2 ) show that OS+ performs best out of all the models , even taking into account sentences with LUs not in FN for which OS+ can not disambiguate . 
FS performs the 
2168worst out of all models on R - S ET , because it can- not Ô¨Ånd newly added frames from the latest FN re- lease , but improves on the F - S ET(FS can Ô¨Ånd can- didate frames for LUs not in FN ) . 
The scores on the F - S ETwere lower for all baselines , suggest- ing that sentences with LUs not in FN are more difÔ¨Åcult to classify ‚Äì this could be because FN is missing frames that can express the full meaning of these LUs . 
TC has a good performance , but is far from being unbeatable ‚Äì when measuring Kendall ‚Äôs 
over the R - S ET , OS+ performs better than TC . 
4 Conclusions We described a FrameNet frame disambiguation resource of 5,042 sentence - word pairs , and 1,000 LUs that are new to FN ‚Äì the largest corpus of this type outside of FN . 
Since the submission of this paper , the corpus has grown to over 9,000 sentence - word pairs . 
We also provide conÔ¨Ådence scores for each candidate frame that are based on inter - worker disagreement . 
We made a case for this kind of disagreement reÔ¨Çecting genuine cases of ambiguity in FrameNet frames , caused by : child - parent relations between frames , frames with overlapping deÔ¨Ånitions , or compositions of frames making up the meaning of a word . 
The evaluation method we proposed uses the scores for multiple frames , and is thus able to differen- tiate between frames that still apply to the word , but with less clarity , and frames that capture the wrong meaning . 
Our goal was to build a resource that recognizes different levels of ambiguity in the expression of the frames in the text , and allows a more fair evaluation of performance of frame dis- ambiguation systems .
